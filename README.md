OriginAnalysis
==============

This tool can be used for origin analysis of source code in software engineering artifacts. 
Using this tool one can track down the merging,splitting,renaming and move of the methods in the java source code. 
Therefore, the developers can find out why and what are the methods changed from the previous version. 
This will help the develpers making clean and bug free code for the current version and they can easily figure out
the reason for mergin/splitting of the method and change accordingly for their current version work. 

In a nutshell, this will help to figure out the evolution of the software.

I want to improve the work and try to enhance for the class lebel merging,splitting and renaming detection.
Here, in this project, the LHDiff line tracker has been used for similarity check and candidate set creation.
Further, body similarity, name similarity, caller/callee analysis has been performed in order to improve the 
accuracy of this tool.
